## Project: Data Wrangling and Analysis of WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

## Project Overview

Real-world data rarely comes clean. The project is well designed to teach us three ways of data gathering. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. The three modes of data gathering I used are downloading data directly, downloading data programmatically, and storing data using twitter APIs. Analysis and visualizations is done using Python (and its libraries) and SQL.
